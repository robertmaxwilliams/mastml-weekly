Week of 2018 June 4-10

## Daily Reports

### Monday

- Get classification images to show up.
- Converted html strings into `xml.dom` DOM elements. (more bug-resistant and inspectable)
- Added new dict for different plots between classification and regression but reuse everything else.
- Investigating ways to automatically provide suggestions to the user based on sklearn documentation.
- Made it so MASTML directly calls sklearn with model parameters from conf, destroys bugs to do with misnaming parameters, and throws readable meaningful errors.
 
### Tuesday

- Sorta got classification working with data splits
- Had good Skype call with Ryan
- Started on demo server where user uploads `.csv` and `.conf` files then spits out `index.html`
- Investigating ways to automatically make a conf template and documentation (better documentation soon hopefully!)
