# mastml-weekly
week of 2018 May 14-21

### Monday
- We installed working MASTML on Luke's laptop:
  * Viewed some ipython notebooks, but got errors
  * Installed more conda packages trying to fix those errors
  * viewed documentation and performed their build process
  * Got our images and html file showing an optimization process

- Tried to build from scratch in a docker image, steps are in `install-instuctions.md`, but they are imperfect and overcomplex

- Used the dell ubunutu laptop and started building conda on there to get a better grasp in how to build mast-ml
